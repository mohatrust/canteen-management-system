This software system is a Canteen Management System for the students and faculty members of any college. This system will be designed to minimize the queues in the canteen and make hassle-free payments using the unique id provided to the students and the faculty by the college.

steps.................................................
clone this repository or download the archive zip file

First of all unzip the file and place it in the htdocs folder(you should have installed XAMPP prior to this procedure)  
then create a database called 'ecommerce'(without the quotes), then import the ecommerce.sql file to the databse 

once your done importing direct your browser to the following address

http://localhost:8080/cafeteria-portal-master

OVERVIEW


The pages accessible by the customers include the home page(index.php), full menu (full_menu.php), login (customer_login), register (customer_register.php) and detail of the team(about_us.php)

There is also an admin access(admin_area) to add,remove products from the menu and keep a record of the orders. Basically it gives the admin a GUI to update the database.

'ecommerce.sql' contains the databse information . Import it into phpmyadmin to create the database.

The remaining folders contain the codes for the db connection, bootstrap, javascript,etc.

Any design improvements are highly appreciated
